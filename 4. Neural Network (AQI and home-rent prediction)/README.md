# Air Quality Index prediction  and Home Rent Prediction (Using Multiple Neural Network MLPRegression)
* I collected the dataset from following source
[Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/rohanrao/air-quality-data-in-india)

* Observe the dataset and performed data cleaning if required

* I used this [MLPRegressor] python library to build and fit my model

* Calculated Mean squared error, Absolute squared error, Root mean squared error to evaluate model perfomance.
