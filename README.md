# Artificial-Intelligence

This is Artificial intelligence lab task submission.

 Lab task for AI course:

1) Build a simple Tic-Toc-Toe game using MinMax algorithm.

2) Calculate air quality index using Linear regression (you can use Beijing air quality index available, SK learn, SVM etc).

3) Estimate house rent using Linear regression (you can use available python libraries).

4) Implement Task 2 and Task 3 using Neural Network technics. 

5) Build a simple Text suggesting system using Naive Bayes.
